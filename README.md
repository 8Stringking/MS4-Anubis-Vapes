# Introduction

Welcome to the online e-commerce store Anubis Vapes! This is an online store using the Django framework alongside a postgresql database. In this shop not only can the user select as many items to purchase and use the secure checkout to pay for their items. The user can also register an account with Anubis Vapes to be able to pick items and place them in their own wishlist which will save on their account, and also have the ability to pre-save their delivery information to make purchases even easier!

## Purpose
  [Go to the top](#contents)

The main purpose of this app is an e-commerce store, but also a site that allows users to shop for vape items to stop them smoking. I used to smoke 50g tobacco a week and since vaping my health has improved drastically, so to provide a completely accessible site, that delivers some great products that everyone can see and use is very important to me. 

The target audience is people that already vape, or people that want to stop smoking themselves, but also people who suffer medical conditions who may need to stop smoking. These can be people from all ages.

This is also a vape shop that has been designed with security in mind. From the secure checkout, and to pages that have restricted access for the users to keep their information safe, such as the wishlist and user profile (including delivery information)
